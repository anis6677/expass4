// The way I worked 
was to create new dataSources from DB.mv.db and should use or convert h2 database.

Experiment 1: Preparation and optional tutorial

I complete tutorial with an overview and a gentle introduction to JPA. 
The goal is to set up a Java application that uses JPA for storing entities in a database.

Setup:
In this project  I using gradle and run.
Run the class Main. 
Used to JPA and understand the project setup.

The technical problems whit installation Java Persistence Architecture (JPA)  i resolved like task said in (https://github.com/webminz/dat250-jpa-tutorial/blob/master/README.md) 
I have problems when I using incompatible versions of Java, JPA, database driver.
Then solution was ensure that the versions of JPA, Java, and the database driver are compatible. I check for updates and downgrades to resolve version conflicts.

I du simple test case to test basic CRUD operations using JPA
•	a link to your code for experiment 2 above. Make sure the included test case passes!
The screenshots doing under the task.
 
Experiment 2: Banking/Credit Card example JPA was more dificult spesial
Implement the domain model for credit cards similar to the Person-Address-Examples like (object-relational mappings) and associations in the domain model.
